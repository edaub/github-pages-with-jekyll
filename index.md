Personal reflections on menswear and style.

## Why the title?

This blog's title is a play on "On Food and Cooking," Harold McGee's classic book on the science of cooking that first popularized cooking science to a mass audience. I love to cook, and my own meticulous and scientific approach to cooking has been profoundly influenced by McGee and others that take a more scientific approach to cooking (such as Alton Brown and Kenji Lopez-Alt).

## About Me

My name is Eric Daub. I am an American Expat living in South West England with a lovely wife and daughter. I am a physicist by training, though my primary professional interest is writing computer software to solve challenging scientific problems. Among my many interests outside of work, I enjoy learning about the stories behind why we wear what we wear, both classic menswear and our current more casual world. This blog is where I record my musings on personal style and how it is inevitably intertwined with my life.
